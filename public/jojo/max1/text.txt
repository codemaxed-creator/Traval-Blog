Aarav, a quiet artist from Mumbai, returns to his coastal hometown after ten years to attend his childhood friend Meera’s wedding. The sea breeze, the same narrow streets, and an old sketchbook bring back buried memories — and something strange: Meera acts like she doesn’t remember the bond they once had.

As Aarav spends more time there, he finds letters hidden inside the sketchbook — letters he never wrote, but all signed with his name. Slowly he realizes Meera lost her memory after an accident years ago, and her fiancé is the doctor who saved her.

On the night before her wedding, she finds one last sketch of them watching a sunset — titled “Tornami”, Italian for “Come back to me.”
In that moment, she remembers everything… but morning always comes, and choices still have to be made.
